## Project Goal Statement
> Our goal is to create an application that will gamify the act of walking or running. It does this by translating a user's movement into a trackable resource that is then applied to a RPG (Role-Playing Game) system. The game will utilize both passive and active play. Although it will reward the user more if they are actively using the application while engaging in any physical activity. This is done by providing the user with challenges, achievements and collectables. Incentivising users to stay more physically active through the use of our mobile app.

## Technologies Used
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) (Android Mobile Development Environment.)
- [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (NoSQL Realtime Database, Google Authentication w/Firebase.)
